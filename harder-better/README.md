# harder-better

## Description

Make a basic sampler / sequencer with Sinatra


## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Be able to build an API to expose and trigger song samples on your machine
* Rock


### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* Sinatra for taking `POST` requests
* System calls to play songs



## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `daft.rb`
  * `rock.rb`

### Requirements

* Running `daft.rb` should start a server with endpoints described below
* Running `rock.rb` should make requests to that server to play a "song"


## Normal Mode

Download the samples from [here](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/daft-samples). Make an endpoint for each family, with query params for variants: e.g.

`POST /harder`
`POST /better?v=2`

The `rock.rb` script should play several samples in the style and timing of your choosing.

## Hard Mode

Use `sleep` judiciously to play a reasonable cover with a backtrack (see `beat.mp3`)

## Nightmare Mode

Build a metronome loop in the server, and make sure triggered samples happen on the next beat.
