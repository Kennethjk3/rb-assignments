## Details

Record format:

### Good news Rubyists!
* We have a week of records tracking what we shipped at Planet Express.
* I need you to answer a few questions for Hermes.


### Deliverables

* A gist with two files:
  * `planet_express_logs.csv`
  * `planet_express.rb`

### Requirements

* You should use the ruby "CSV" library
* Do not make changes to the `planet_express_logs.csv` file


## Normal Mode

1. How much money did we make this week?
2. Also, bonuses are paid to employees who pilot the Planet Express

* Different employees have favorite destinations they always pilot to
* Fry - pilots to Earth (because he isn't allowed into space)
* Amy - pilots to Mars (so she can visit her family)
* Bender - pilots to Uranus (teeheee...)
* Leela - pilots everywhere else because she is the only responsible one

3. How many trips did each employee pilot?

* They get a bonus of 10% of the money for the shipment as the bonus
* How much of a bonus did each employee get?


## Hard Mode

* How much money did we make broken down by planet? ie.. how much did we make shipping to Earth? Mars? Saturn? etc.

## Nightmare Mode

* uses classes for each shipment, such as a `class Shipment`
