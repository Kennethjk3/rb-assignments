# todo-cli

## Description

Write a command line todo manager

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

* Developing larger applications that interact with a database
* How to define and leverage relations to simplify database interactions

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* Schema migrations and `ActiveRecord` models to interact with data
* `belongs_to`, `has_many` and `has_many_through` to define relationship
* The query methods generated by the above

## Details

### Deliverables

A repo (based on [our class skeleton](https://github.com/TIY-DC-ROR-2015-Jan/model-skeleton)) with a `todo` script with several subcommands.

## Normal Mode

Start a new project, and [enable logging](https://github.com/TIY-DC-ROR-2015-Jan/course-notes/commit/7712209624ffa823ace8b24cebe70c3f0f9a184d).

In this mode, each todo item belongs to a single list. Declare and use ActiveRecord relations wherever possible.

Implement the following subcommands

* `add [list name] [todo item]` adds a todo item to a list (creating the list, if needed)
* `due [n] [time]` marks a todo item as due on the given date
* `done [n]` marks the todo item with id n as done
* `list` shows all incomplete todo items
* `list [name]` shows only items from the given list
* `list all` shows all items, including completed ones (with some visual cue for what is complete)
* `next` picks and shows a random item (choosing one with a due date if there are any)
* `search [string]` shows todo items containing the given string


## Hard Mode

Any of the following:

* Add users, who must "log in" before editing, and who each have their own lists and items
* Use [thor](https://github.com/erikhuda/thor) to make a better command line interface
* Add more sorting and filtering options for list: recently created, by name, past due, etc.
* Keep track of when items are completed, and add an option to display statistics about them
