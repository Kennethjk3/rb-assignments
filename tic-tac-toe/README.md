In this assignment, we'll implement a version of tic-tac-toe that we can play from the command line.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Understand IO and be able to interact with users
* Know how to use data structures to model state
* Think about how to structure logic in longer programs

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* `def` to define functions and express functionality
* `gets` and `puts` to handle IO
* control flow via `if` / `else`
* looping constructs like `while` or `until`

## Details

### Deliverables

* A script `tic-tac-toe.rb`

### Requirements

* Running `ruby tic-tac-toe.rb` should play a game of tic-tac-toe in the terminal.
* No `rubocop` warnings or errors.


## Normal Mode

The script should play a game of tic-tac-toe to a win or draw, and then print the game's result. Each turn, the user specifies their input by entering a square number, and the script prints out a display of the resulting board. The player chooses a random open square.

## Hard Mode

Include a 2-player mode where player 2 is also a human.

## Nightmare Mode

Add better AI (hardcoding "if the board is this, play this" is tractable, but there are other approaches, depending on how nightmarish you want to go).

## Notes

This project is deliberately non-proscriptive. Start. Write some code. Don't worry too much about getting it perfect. Make some mistakes. We'll revisit this shortly.
